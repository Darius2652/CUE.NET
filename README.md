# CUE.NET
C# (.NET) Wrapper library around the Corsair CUE-SDK

The current Version should be stable (only keyboard support - mouse and headset might work but is completly untested) and soon be released as V1.0. (Use the latest nuget-package or compile from source - V0.1 is really outdated.)  

Please take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/DarthAffe/CUE.NET/wiki) for some help on how to use the library. Tutorials will be rewritten soon.

Drop me a message if you need help, something is missing, behaves weird or doesn't feel good (from a programmer's point of view)!

*You need to check "Include prerelease" to see the package in Visual Studio.*
